- 👋 Hi, I’m cjon256
- 👀 I’m interested in computers, like unhealthily so. I also powerlift and study foreign languanges (primarily Japanese).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS cert stuff, and deepening my python skills. Once AWS is a bit more solid I'll be focusing on Terraform and K8s.
- 💻 My main laptops are macbooks (intel for work and M1 Air personal use)
- 💾 My homelab is 3 servers and some pis
  - eve-ng for network simulations
  - my old proxmox server running my old docker swarm and most of my services
  - my new harvester (i.e from the rancher folks) box which I plan to migrate most of my services over to
  - a old synology SAN which hope to replace with TrueNAS Scale once the services are migrated
  - and a few Raspberry Pis for jump servers and the like
- 📫 How to reach me  3659487+cjon256@users.noreply.github.com
- 💞️ Not currently looking for collaborators, need to actually study a few things first
