- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m cjon256
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computers, like unhealthily so. :D I also powerlift and study foreign languanges (primarily Japanese).
- ðŸ•¸ I helped start up a hosting company you've probably never heard of (employee #4 I think) and ended up being resonsible for the network.
  - We had 4-5 9's uptime most months and got pretty big thanks to some lucky breaks, but eventually sold to the company I work at now
- I'm pretty solid on AWS and have the Solutions Architect Associate certification
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on deepening my python skills and working on my understanding of Terraform. I'm also dabbling in Javascript and React so as to have some understanding of front end development (although I'm more back-end focused). Next up is building more in depth understanding of K8s with maybe a focus on getting comfortable reading Go code.
- ðŸ’» My main laptops are macbooks (Mpro for work and M1 Air for personal use)
- ðŸ’¾ My homelab is 3 servers and some pis
  - my NUC that runs some basic services on plain old docker
  - my old proxmox server running my old docker swarm which I've been using as a dev platform
  - my new harvester (i.e from the rancher folks) box which I plan to migrate most of my services
  - a old synology SAN which hope to replace with TrueNAS Scale or similar once the services are migrated
  - and a few Raspberry Pis for jump servers and the like
