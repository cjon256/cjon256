- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m cjon256
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computers, really software. I also powerlift and study foreign languages (primarily Japanese).
- ðŸ•¸ I helped start up a hosting company you've probably never heard of (employee #4 I think) and ended up being responsible for the network.
  - We had 4-5 9's uptime most months and got pretty big thanks to some lucky breaks, but eventually sold to the company I work at now
- I'm pretty solid on AWS and have the Solutions Architect Associate certification
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on deepening my python skills and working on my understanding of Terraform. Next up getting comfortable working with Go code. I also find data science fascinating, and think a lot of the next decade will be companies finding ways to make LLMs useful and safe.
- ðŸ’» My main laptops are macbooks, but I have been using Linux since the 1990's. Mostly just happy as long as it is Unix-based.
- ðŸ’¾ My homelab is 6 servers and a couple pis, but is pretty neglected at this point. Half the severs are off and I only really use two of them.
  - I have a k8s server running which I was using as a dev platform, but as my focus has gotten more an the SDLC side I have doing less with it.
  - and a few Raspberry Pis for jump servers and the like, plus a Synology for video streaming and local backup. It is my local git server.
